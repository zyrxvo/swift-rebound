# Welcome to swift-rebound

This package is a Swift implementation of some of the basic tools and functionality of [REBOUND](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound), the open source N-body software.

The development of this package, based on REBOUND's implementations, is only supported by me and is not wholly endorsed by the creators and authors of REBOUND. As such, the accuracy or completeness of the available methods is not guaranteed and feature parity with REBOUND should not be expected.

This package was done as part of a course project for learning and understanding some of the numerical methods associated with planetary dynamics. 

The ease of use of this package is limited due to the nature of how Swift and the Swift Package Manager (SPM) handles importing and embedding third-party packages. Hopefully, as the SPM improves it will become easier to use this package in a Swift Playground rather than needing to embed it into another package (such as an executable package) or a full-blown app.
